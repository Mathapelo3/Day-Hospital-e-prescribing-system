HOSPITAL-E-PRESCRIPTION-SYSTEM

The project involves developing a cloud-based website tailored for day hospitals to manage electronic prescriptions (e-prescribing) efficiently. The system aims to streamline the prescription process, improve medication management, enhance patient safety, and ensure regulatory compliance.

Key Features and Functionality:

User Management: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to define user roles such as doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and administrators with specific permissions and privileges.

Patient Profile is created and managed with detailed information, including medical history, allergies, current medications, and contact details. 

Prescription Creation: Enable authorized healthcare professionals to create electronic prescriptions, including dosage instructions, medication details, frequency, and duration. 

Medication Database: Maintain a comprehensive database of medications, including generic and brand names, classifications, strengths, and formulations.

Drug Interaction Checks: Implement algorithms to check for potential drug interactions and contraindications based on patient history and prescribed medications. 

Electronic Signature: Allow doctors to electronically sign prescriptions to validate authenticity and ensure legal compliance. Order Management: Manage prescription orders, track fulfilment status, and notify patients or caregivers when medications are ready for pickup or delivery.

Reporting and Analytics: Generate reports and analytics on prescription volumes, medication adherence, drug utilization patterns, and other key metrics for performance evaluation and decision-making. 

Integration with Pharmacy Systems: Integrate with pharmacy management systems to facilitate seamless transmission of e-prescriptions, refill requests, and medication dispensing. 

Compliance and Security: Implement robust data encryption, audit trails, and compliance with regulatory standards such as HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) to ensure patient data confidentiality and integrity. Technology Stack:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js 
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB Cloud Platform: AWS (Amazon Web Services) or Microsoft Azure for hosting, scalability, and data storage 
Additional Tools: API integration for pharmacy systems, encryption libraries for data security, analytics tools for reporting Benefits:

Efficiency: Reduces paperwork, manual errors, and processing time associated with traditional prescription methods. 
Accuracy: Minimizes medication errors through drug interaction checks and electronic verification. 
Patient Safety: Enhances patient safety by maintaining accurate medication records and allergy information. 
Compliance: Ensures compliance with regulatory requirements for electronic prescribing and patient data protection. 
Accessibility: Enables healthcare providers to access and manage prescriptions securely from any device with internet access. 
Scalability: Cloud-based architecture allows for scalability to accommodate growing hospital needs and user volumes.
